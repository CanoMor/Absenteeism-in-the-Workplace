# Absenteeism-in-the-Workplace

This project focuses on creating an **HR dashboard** to analyze absenteeism in the workplace, based on an approved wireframe. The goal is to help HR understand trends in employee absences using interactive visualizations while also calculating a wage increase for non-smokers within an insurance budget of $983,221. To build this, I worked with three imported data files containing absenteeism records, compensation details, and reasons for absence. I then used **SQL to query, combine, clean, and format the data**, ensuring it was structured properly for analysis.  

The final Power BI dashboard features line charts that track absenteeism hours across the week and month, as well as categorical breakdowns of absence reasons. Additionally, I created comparative charts to analyze the workloads of social drinkers and social smokers on an average workday. This project not only demonstrates my SQL skills in data preparation but also highlights my ability to design creative, insightful dashboards using Power BI, making complex data easily interpretable for HR decision-making.

The "absenteeism-in-the-workplace" folder is set up to recreate the original database since it couldnâ€™t be downloaded directly. Inside, there are two subfolders: imported_data_files and query. The imported_data_files folder contains three CSV files, absenteeism_at_work.csv, compensation.csv, and reasons.csv, which hold all the original data. The query folder contains an SQL file that connects, cleans, and formats these CSV files, similar to how they were structured in the database. There's also a Power BI dashboard file that brings everything together for analysis and visualization. This setup keeps the data organized and ensures it can be used in Power BI just like it was when stored in the database.
